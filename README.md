# Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) for Chemical Reactions

## Overview

This Python script implements a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) for modeling chemical reactions. It's designed to simulate the time evolution of a system of chemical species undergoing a set of reactions, taking into account the stochastic nature of chemical processes at the molecular level.

## Features

- Simulates multiple chemical species (A, B, C, P, Aj, Bj, Cj, D)
- Implements temperature-dependent reaction rates using the Arrhenius equation
- Handles multiple reaction channels
- Made for heterogeneous reactions
- Allows for multiple simulation runs
- This python script is configurated to run the simulation of the AA8011 alloy reaction methods 
- ![Reaction Methods](reaction.jpeg "Reaction Methods")

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Import the `SSA` class from the script:

   ```python
   from ssa_simulation import SSA
   ```

2. Set up the simulation parameters:

   ```python
   params = {
       'k1': 1e-4, 'k2': 8e-6, 'k3': 1e-11, 'k4': 6e-5, 'k5': 3e-4, 'k6': 4e-4,
       'A0': 1000, 'B0': 1000, 'C0': 2000, 'Cj0': 0, 'P0': 0, 'T0': 50,
       'E1': 363, 'E2': 363, 'E3': 363, 'E4': 363, 'E5': 363, 'E6': 363,
       'beta': 10, 'q': 1.5, 'Nc': 10000, 'shape': 1000
   }
   ```

3. Create an instance of the SSA class:

   ```python
   ssa = SSA(params)
   ```

4. Run the simulation and get the results:

   ```python
   results = ssa.organize()
   ```

5. Analyze the results using pandas DataFrame operations.

## Parameters

- `k1` to `k6`: Reaction rate constants
- `A0`, `B0`, `C0`, `Cj0`, `P0`: Initial number of particles for each species
- `T0`: Initial temperature
- `E1` to `E6`: Activation energies for reactions
- `beta`: Temperature increase rate
- `q`: Heterogeneity parameter
- `Nc`: Number of simulation runs
- `shape`: Number of steps in each simulation run

## Output

The `organize()` method returns a pandas DataFrame containing the time evolution of all species concentrations, temperature, reaction propensities, and other relevant data for each simulation run.

## Notes

- The simulation uses the Gillespie algorithm to determine the time and nature of each reaction event.
- The code implements temperature-dependent reaction rates and heterogeneous reactions.
- Multiple runs can be performed to account for the stochastic nature of the process.
